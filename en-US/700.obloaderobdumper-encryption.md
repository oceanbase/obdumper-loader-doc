# Security features

By default, OBLOADER & OBDUMPER can run after you explicitly specify sensitive information such as the password on the command line. To enhance information security, OBLOADER & OBDUMPER V4.2.0 and later provides methods to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information on command lines.

## Use secure-gen to encrypt information


1. Install [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/source/?spm=a2c4g.42216.0.0.7097553fHQEFiE) and configure environment variables.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>To use secure-gen to encrypt information, you must install the OpenSSL toolkit. For more information, see the "<strong>View the help information of secure-gen</strong>" section in this topic. </p>
   </main>

2. Verify that OpenSSL is installed.

   ```shell
   $ which openssl

   /usr/bin/openssl
   ```

3. Encrypt sensitive files in the local path.

   ```shell
   $ ./secure-gen -n <file_path>
   ```

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>Sensitive information files must meet the specifications described in <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23095_01/Platform.93/ATGProgGuide/html/s0204propertiesfileformat01.html">Property File Format</a>. You can also edit the sensitive information to be encrypted in the CLI. Example:</p>
   </main>

   1. Run the following command in the `{ob-loader-dumper}/tools/` directory.

      ```shell
      $ ./secure-gen -i
      ```

   2. Edit the parameters to be encrypted in the CLI and then enter `:wq` to save and exit.

      ```shell
      # Input the sensitive fields below in plain-text respectively.
      # Note you can leave any of them as blank, ob-loader-dumper will parse from cli args first, and override any field if there is a conflict.
      #   
      # Database password.
      oceanbase.jdbc.password=******
      # Database password for sys tenant.
      oceanbase.jdbc.sys.password=******
      # Access key for cloud storages like OSS & S3.
      cloud.storage.access.key=******
      # Secret key for cloud storages like OSS & S3.
      cloud.storage.secret.key=******

      :wq
      ```

      The following table lists the sensitive parameters that can be encrypted by OBLOADER & OBDUMPER.

      | **Parameter** | **Description** |
      |-----------|--------|
      | oceanbase.jdbc.password | Optional. The password of a business tenant of OceanBase Database.  |
      | oceanbase.jdbc.sys.password | Optional. The password of the sys tenant in OceanBase Database.  |
      | cloud.storage.access.key | Optional. The AccessKey ID used to access a cloud storage service such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) or Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS).  |
      | cloud.storage.secret.key | Optional. The AccessKey secret used to access a cloud storage service such as Amazon S3 or Alibaba Cloud OSS.  |

4. You can choose whether to use an existing key as prompted.

   ```shell
   $ ./secure-gen
   Detected that a key already exists, do you want to use it?
   If not, a new key will be generated and overwrite the existing key (y/n):
   ```
   1. Enter `n` to regenerate a key pair by using OpenSSL. By default, the key pair is stored in the `<Root directory of the user>/.loaddump/secure/` directory. By default, the public key file is <code>key.pem.pub</code>, and the private key file is <code>key.pem</code>.

      ```shell
      Detected that a key already exists, do you want to use it?
      If not, a new key will be generated and overwrite the existing key (y/n): n
      Generating RSA private key, 4096 bit long modulus
      ............++
      .......................................................++
      e is 65537 (0x10001)
      Writing RSA key

      The key pair has been generated under the directory /Users/chang/.loaddump, please keep it safe.
      The encrypted file /Users/chang/.loaddump/secure/secure.rsa has been generated for sensitive information.

      If you want to use it, please fill in the corresponding content in conf/decrypt.properties properly.
      ```

   2. Enter `y` to use an existing key pair. OBLOADER & OBDUMPER load the key pair from the <code><Root directory of the user>/.loaddump/secure/</code> directory and generate an encrypted file, such as `secure.rsa`.

      ```shell
      Detected that a key already exists, do you want to use it? If not, a new key will be generated and overwrite the existing key (y/n): y
      The encrypted file /Users/chang/.loaddump/secure/secure.rsa has been generated for sensitive information.

      If you want to use it, please fill in the corresponding content in conf/decrypt.properties properly.
      ```

5. Verify whether the key pair and encrypted file are generated.

   ```shell
   $ ls ~/.loaddump/secure/
   key.pem     key.pem.pub    secure.rsa
   ```

6. Enter the encrypted information in `decrypt.properties` in the `{ob-loader-dumper}/conf/decrypt.properties` directory.

   ```shell
   # Absolute path of your secure file, whose name is secure.rsa by default.
   # secure.filePath=

   # Absolute path of your private key. whose name is key.pem by default.
   # privateKey.filePath=

   # Decrypt class name. Fill in this field only if you need a custom mechanism of decryption.
   # decrypt.className=
   ```

### View the help information of secure-gen

secure-gen is an executable Shell script. It can encrypt sensitive information fields by using the RSA algorithm. When you run OBLOADER or OBDUMPER, it will parse `decrypt.properties` in the `{ob-loader-dumper}/conf` directory to securely obtain sensitive information.

secure-gen is located in the `{ob-loader-dumper}/tools/` directory. You can run `./secure-gen -h` or directly enter `./secure-gen` to view the help information of secure-gen.

```shell
$ ./secure-gen -h

Usage: ./secure-gen [-n <file>][-i][-h]
Description:
-n: Specify a to-be-encrypted file of sensitive contents in plain-text, use -i to check out the format.
-i: Input sensitive contents in interactive mode.
-h: Display this message.
```

## Customize an encryption/decryption mechanism

If `OpenSSL` is not installed, you can perform the following steps to customize an encryption/decryption mechanism.

1. Create a plaintext file for encryption.

   The file to be encrypted must meet the specifications described in "Properties File Format." For more information, visit [Properties File Format](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23095_01/Platform.93/ATGProgGuide/html/s0204propertiesfileformat01.html).

2. Write a decryption class file in Java. The class definition must meet the following requirements:

   - A parameterless constructor function must be defined.

   - The class must have a non-static method: `public String decrypt(String encryptRaw)`. The `encryptRaw` formal parameter indicates the encrypted text. The return value is the decrypted text.

3. Package the decryption class as a JAR package and place the package in the `{ob-loader-dumper}/lib/` directory.

4. Configure corresponding content in `decrypt.properties` in the `{ob-loader-dumper}/conf` directory.

### Examples

Create a Maven project and write a `CustomDecryptor` class. Use Base64 for encoding and decoding.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>In a production environment, you can choose an appropriate encryption/decryption algorithm as needed. </p>
</main>

1. Create a plaintext file for encryption and encode the file by using Base64.

   ```shell
   # Create a plaintext file.
   $ vi password.txt
   # Enter the following content in the file. Then, save the file and exit.
   oceanbase.jdbc.password=******
   oceanbase.jdbc.sys.password=******

   # Encrypt the encoded file as custom.key.
   $ echo $(base64 password.txt) > /user/loaddump/custom.key
   ```

2. Create a Java project. In the project, `CustomDecryptor.java` is a custom decryption class that you need to write.

<img src="https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/obloaderobdumper/420/encryption.png" width = "336" height = "289" alt="customdecryptor" />

3. Write the `CustomDecryptor` class.

   ```shell
   package com.example.decrypt;

   import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
   import sun.misc.BASE64Decoder;

   public class CustomDecryptor {

      public CustomDecryptor() {}

       /**
       * This method takes an encrypted string, decrypt it, and return it as a plain string.
       */
      public String decrypt(String encryptedRaw) throws Exception {
          BASE64Decoder decoder = new BASE64Decoder();
          return new String(decoder.decodeBuffer(encryptedRaw), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
     }
   }

   ```

4. Package the `CustomDecryptor` class as a JAR package and place the package in the `{ob-loader-dumper}/lib/` directory to finish setting the decryptor.

   ```shell
   $ mvn package && mv target/example-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar path/to/ob-loader-dumper/lib/
   ```

5. Enter corresponding content in `decrypt.properties` in the `{ob-loader-dumper}/conf/` directory.

   ```shell
   # Absolute path of your secure file, whose name is secure.rsa by default.
   secure.filePath=ï½ž/tmp/custom.key
   # Absolute path of your private key. whose name is key.pem by default.
   # privateKey.filePath=
   # Decrypt class name. Fill in this field only if you need a custom mechanism of decryption.
   decrypt.className=com.example.decrypt.CustomDecryptor
   ```

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>If you use a custom SDK for encryption and decryption, the <code>privateKey.filePath</code> parameter is optional. </p>
   </main>

6. Securely run OBLOADER & OBDUMPER.

   ```shell
   ./obdumper -hxx.x.x.x -P2883 -t example -D example --csv --all
   ```

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>When you run OBLOADER &amp; OBDUMPER, you do not need to explicitly declare the <code>-p</code>/<code>--password</code> or <code>--sys-password</code> option. </p>
   </main>
