# Environmental Preparation 


Before you run OBDUMPER, ensure that you have the appropriate operating environment and privileges:

Operating Environments 
-------------------------------------------



|            **Environment**            |                                                                                      **Requirements**                                                                                      |

| Operating system (OS)                 | Linux, MacOSX, or Windows 7+ .  We recommend that you use personal PCs only for testing purposes and use computers with higher specifications for large-scale data export. |
| Java environment                      | You have installed Java Development Kit (JDK) V1.8 or later and have specified the `JAVA_HOME` system environment variable.                                                                |
| Character set                         | UTF-8.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Java virtual machine (JVM) parameters | Modify the memory parameters of the Java virtual machine to prevent memory overflow.                                                                                                       |



Privileges 
-------------------------------

When you connect OBDUMPER to the OceanBase Database and use it to export data, you must have the following privileges:

* The user that you use to connect to the OceanBase Database must have the privilege to run the `SELECT` command.

  

* You have specified the values for `--sys-user` and `--sys-password` in the data import command to enable OBDUMPER to query internal system tables through root@sys or proxyro@sys. These two options are not required in limited mode.
