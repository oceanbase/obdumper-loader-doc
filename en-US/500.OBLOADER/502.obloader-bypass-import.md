# Bypass import

## Background information

OceanBase Database allows you to insert data into a database by using bypass import. In other words, OceanBase Database can directly write data into `data` files. With the bypass import feature, you can bypass interfaces in the SQL layer and directly allocate space and insert data into data files, thereby improving the `data` import efficiency.

## Scenarios

The bypass import feature applies to the following scenarios:

- Data migration and synchronization: In data migration or synchronization, a large amount of data of different types must be migrated from different data sources to OceanBase Database. Conventional SQL interfaces cannot meet the requirement on timeliness.

- Conventional extract, transform, and load (ETL): After data is extracted and transformed in the source, a large amount of data must be loaded to the destination within a short time. The bypass import technology can improve the import performance.

Data loading from text files or other data sources to OceanBase Database: Bypass import can accelerate the data loading process.

## Considerations

- In bypass import, the RPC port instead of the SQL port is required to transmit data.

- Data to be imported is submitted at the table level instead of the session or transaction level.

- Retry or resumable transmission is not supported.

- Bit data types are not supported.

- Virtual generated columns are not supported.

## Command-line options for bypass import

   <h4>Notice</h4>
   <p>OBLOADER can connect to an OBServer node or OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) for bypass import. The version requirements are as follows: <ul><li>OBServer node: V4.2.0 or later. </li><li>ODP: V4.1.3 while the OBServer node version must be V4.2.1 or later. </li></ul></p>

| Option | Description | ApsaraDB for OceanBase & ODP | OceanBase Database & ODP | OceanBase Database & OBServer node |
|-----------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|
| --direct | Specifies to use bypass import.  | Required | Required | Required |
| --parallel | The degree of parallelism (DOP) on the server.  | Optional | Optional | Optional |
| --rpc-port | The inner RPC port of the server. You can obtain the RPC port as follows:<ul><li>In the case of connection to the ODP server:<ul><li>In ApsaraDB for OceanBase, the RPC port of the ODP server is 3307 by default. </li><li> In OceanBase Database, the RPC port of the ODP server is 2885 by default. You can change the port by using the `-s` option when you start ODP. </li></ul></li><li>In the case of direct connection to an OBServer node, you can query the DBA_OB_SERVER system view in the sys tenant for the RPC port of the OBServer node, which is 2882 by default. </li></ul> | Required | Required | Required |
| -u(--user) | The username that you use to log on to the database.  | Required | Required | Required |
| -P(--port) | The SQL port number.  | Required | Required | Required |
| -t(--tenant) | The tenant name of the cluster.  | Optional<br>If this option is not specified, partition calculation may be skipped. | Required | Required |
| -c(--cluster) | The cluster name of the database.  | Optional | Required | - |
| --public-cloud | Indicates that the database environment is ApsaraDB for OceanBase.  | Required | - | - |
| --no-sys | Specifies that the import does not rely on the sys tenant. This option applies only to OceanBase Database of a version earlier than V4.0.0.  | Optional | Optional | Optional |
| --sys-user | The user on which the import relies in the sys tenant. If this option is not specified, the default value `root` takes effect. This option applies only to OceanBase Database of a version earlier than V4.0.0.  | Optional<br>This option is mutually exclusive with the `--no-sys` option. | Optional<br>This option is mutually exclusive with the `--no-sys` option. | Optional<br>This option is mutually exclusive with the `--no-sys` option. |
| --sys-password | The password of the user on which the import relies on in the sys tenant. This option applies only to OceanBase Database of a version earlier than V4.0.0.  | Optional<br>This option is mutually exclusive with the `--no-sys` option. | Optional<br>This option is mutually exclusive with the `--no-sys` option. | Optional<br>This option is mutually exclusive with the `--no-sys` option. |
